                it was a good stay.... quite residential place.... away from
                markets... the only con is that they dont have any option for
                breakfast. it is very quite area after getting tired you can
                sleep in peace

                This is a very good hotel. Well located. Courteous staff made our stay very comfortable. We
                stayed here after having a horrendous experience at a hotel in
                Shivpuri called Shivam Paradise, which reminded us of hell. The
                best part of the room is the shower, which is placed inside the
                false ceiling of the bathroom. The room was very clean and tidy.
                The linen too was clean. Since it's a recently built hotel, they
                didn't have a functional kitchen, but the team was very helpful
                in arranging crockery cutlery and glassware for us for dinner.
                Will definitely stay here when I am in Indore next.
